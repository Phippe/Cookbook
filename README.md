## How to contribute

Add your own recipes as markdown files in the `recipes` folder. If you want to add images, put them in the `public/assets/images` folder and reference them in your recipe (e.g. `![Lemon Blondies](/assets/images/lemon-blondies.jpg)`). Make sure you follow the same format as the other recipes. Finally, open a pull request. Thanks!

For now, the website is deployed by hand, so an approved pull request will not automatically be deployed (yet...).
